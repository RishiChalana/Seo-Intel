# SEO Content Intelligence Pipeline

A multi-agent system that turns a topic into a competitor-grounded, SEO-optimized
content brief: it researches top-ranking pages, fetches and parses their full HTML,
indexes them into a vector store, clusters target keywords by intent, generates a
structured outline grounded in what competitors actually cover, and scores the result
against a deterministic rubric.

Built for a content marketing team's internal tooling — the kind of research
work a strategist currently does manually across search results, keyword tools,
and spreadsheets, compressed into a single API call.

## Why this architecture

**Multi-agent over a single prompt.** A single "write me a content brief about X"
prompt produces a generic outline that could apply to any topic. Splitting into
Research → Index → Keywords → Outline → Score means each stage has one job,
is independently testable, and — critically — later stages are *grounded* in
earlier stages' real output instead of the LLM inventing structure from its
training prior.

**RAG over full competitor articles, not just search snippets.**
The Structure agent doesn't outline from memory. `SerpAPIProvider` fetches each
competitor URL and extracts the full article body with trafilatura (stripping nav,
scripts, and boilerplate), so the Chroma RAG store contains thousands of words of
real competitor content instead of 150-word SERP snippets. Any page that fails to
fetch or yields thin content transparently falls back to its snippet — one
paywalled or bot-blocking URL never degrades the rest of the run.

**Scoring is a rubric, not an LLM opinion.** `eval_agent.py` computes
`keyword_coverage`, `structure_completeness`, and `eeat_signal_score`
deterministically from the outline object, and `readability_grade` via the
established Flesch-Kincaid formula (`textstat`). No "ask the LLM to grade
itself" — that's ungrounded and irreproducible. Anyone can re-run the same
outline through `score_brief()` and get the same number.

**Token and cost telemetry is first-class.** Every Gemini call records its
`prompt_token_count`, `candidates_token_count`, and `thoughts_token_count` (2.5
Flash thinking tokens are billed at the output rate). The `UsageTracker` buckets
usage by response-schema name — so the `usage.by_step` field on every
`ContentBrief` gives a per-pipeline-stage breakdown without threading a "step
name" through any agent's call signature. Cost estimates use a clearly-labeled
pricing table; they're relative visibility, not billing-grade accounting.

**Every external dependency is pluggable.** Search provider, page-content source,
embedding backend, and LLM client are all defined as abstract interfaces with a
production implementation and a local/offline implementation:

| Component | Production | Local/offline default |
|---|---|---|
| Search | `SerpAPIProvider` (needs `SERPAPI_KEY`) | `MockSearchProvider` (deterministic fixtures) |
| Page content | Full HTML fetch + trafilatura extraction (`SCRAPE_FULL_PAGES=true`, default) | SERP snippets only (`SCRAPE_FULL_PAGES=false`, ~150 words/page) |
| Embeddings | `VoyageEmbedder` (needs `VOYAGE_API_KEY`) | `TfidfEmbedder` (scikit-learn, zero cost) |
| LLM | `GeminiLLMClient` (needs `GEMINI_API_KEY`) | `FakeLLMClient` (test stub, injected) |

This means the full pipeline — including the RAG store and every agent — is
tested end-to-end without any paid API key, and swapping to production
providers is a config change, not a code change.

```

Token + cost telemetry is a cross-cutting concern: `GeminiLLMClient` records
`usage_metadata` from every response into a `UsageTracker`. At the end of the
run the tracker snapshots per-step and aggregate totals onto `ContentBrief.usage`.

Orchestrated as a LangGraph `StateGraph` (same pattern used in EchoRoom/Helm)
so each node's input/output is independently inspectable — useful when a run
produces a bad brief and you need to know which stage caused it.

## Real bugs and constraints hit building this

1. **RAG store lost between graph nodes.** Initially stashed the `CompetitorRAGStore`
   (a live Chroma collection, not serializable) directly on the LangGraph state
   dict. LangGraph doesn't guarantee state dict mutations persist as-is across
   async node boundaries — the outline node saw a `KeyError` because the store
   never made it through. Fixed by keeping the store in a closure-scoped
   reference instead of the typed graph state.

2. **Shared embedder instance corrupted fitted state across agents.** The RAG
   store and the keyword-clustering step both call `embedder.fit_transform()`
   on their own corpus (competitor chunks vs. candidate keyword phrases). They
   were sharing one `Embedder` instance — fitting it a second time (for
   keywords) silently invalidated the vocabulary/dimensionality the RAG store
   had already fit, causing a `chromadb.errors.InvalidArgumentError: expecting
   embedding with dimension of 1, got 8` when the outline node later queried
   the store. Fixed by giving each consumer its own embedder instance via a
   factory function rather than sharing one.

3. **Full-page scraping reliably blocked by major SEO properties.** Even with a
   legitimate browser User-Agent string, large content-marketing sites (Mailchimp,
   tool-comparison blogs) return 403 or time out — they detect non-browser
   request patterns. On a typical 3-page live fetch, 1–2 pages succeed (10–20×
   more content than their snippet) and the remainder fall back silently. The
   fallback path is validated end-to-end: any page that returns an error, a
   non-200 status, or fewer than 60 extracted words reverts to its SERP snippet,
   and the pipeline completes normally. Consistent full-page extraction at scale
   would require a scraping API (ScraperAPI, Zyte) with rotating proxies and
   JS rendering — that's the correct production path but is out of scope here.

All three were caught or validated by the test suite before touching production
traffic — which is the actual argument for writing the integration tests in the
first place.

## Running it

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in GEMINI_API_KEY and SERPAPI_KEY

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# POST http://localhost:8000/brief  {"topic": "email marketing automation"}
# GET  http://localhost:8000/docs   (OpenAPI schema with full ContentBrief response)
```

Without `SERPAPI_KEY` set, the app runs against `MockSearchProvider` fixtures —
useful for demoing the full pipeline without a paid search API key.

Set `SCRAPE_FULL_PAGES=false` to skip full-page fetching and use SERP snippets
only (faster, zero extra HTTP requests, but shallower RAG context).

## Testing

```bash
pytest -q
```

40 tests covering: deterministic scoring logic, RAG chunking/retrieval
correctness (including a semantic relevance check — a query about pasta
should retrieve the cooking page, not the finance page), keyword phrase
extraction with real-world noisy text, full-page scraping extraction and
all fallback paths (fetch failure, 403, thin content, mixed success/failure),
token/cost telemetry math and per-step bucketing, and two full end-to-end
pipeline runs through the actual LangGraph graph with fakes injected at the
LLM/search boundary.

## What's out of scope (by design, not oversight)

- Auth/rate-limiting on the API — internal tool, not public-facing
- Persistent storage of past briefs — each run is stateless; add a DB layer
  if history/versioning becomes a requirement
- Scraping-API integration for consistent full-page extraction at scale —
  direct fetches succeed on ~50% of pages due to bot-blocking; ScraperAPI or
  Zyte with rotating proxies would fix this but adds a paid dependency and
  operational overhead not warranted for an internal tool
